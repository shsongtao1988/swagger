# Grails Swagger Plugin Demo
grails swagger plugin demo

In this demo , I use springfoxGrails plugin for Grails 
and secured all apis with Authorization

when I use 
```
compile("io.springfox:springfox-swagger2:${springfox}"){changing = true}
```
This will add  springfox-core:2.9.2.jar to project which will lead to errors.

In this project , I used 2.7.0 version for this project and this lead to a good result.

swagger url is : http://localhost:8083/swagger-ui.html

But I have questions in this project:

Only lowercase Urls are found int this projects and no camelCase found .

That does not fit my current project .

So if anyone can fix this problem . You can contact me.
